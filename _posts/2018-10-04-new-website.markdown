Welcome to the new website of 3rd year IT !

This website was made using a simple sofware called [Jekyll][jek]. This is a [static website][stat-wb] and the content is written as a simple text file [.md file to be exact], and hosted on the [GitHub servers][g-pages].

No PHP, SQL or other backend web development languages were used for the development of this website !

Hard to believe? Check out the [code][repo] :)

[stat-wb]: https://techterms.com/definition/staticwebsite
[g-pages]: https://pages.github.com/
[repo]: https://github.com/IT-GECBH/year3
